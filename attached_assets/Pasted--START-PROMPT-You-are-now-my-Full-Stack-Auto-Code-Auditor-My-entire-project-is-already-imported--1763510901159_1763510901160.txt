📌 START PROMPT

You are now my Full-Stack Auto Code Auditor.
My entire project is already imported into Replit, so DO NOT ask me to paste files.
You have full access to my repository inside this Replit workspace.

Your tasks:

1. FULL PROJECT SCAN (NO FILE PASTING NEEDED)

Scan every folder and file in my project automatically:

app/

pages/

api/

components/

utils/

server/

public/

package.json

next.config.js

.env

any Replit auto-generated files

ANYTHING else inside the repo

Identify:

❌ Replit-generated configs that should be removed

❌ Dead code, broken imports, wrong file paths

❌ Wrong Next.js folder-router mixing (pages vs app)

❌ Missing or broken API routes

❌ Wrong fetch URLs

❌ Wrong form submissions

❌ Missing .env variables

❌ Any bug that will break Vercel deployment

❌ Any issue that breaks email delivery

❌ CORS errors, runtime errors, build failures

❌ Incorrect async/await usage

❌ Anything that will prevent the site from working on Vercel

You must list each issue clearly.

2. FIX EVERYTHING WITHOUT BREAKING MY EXISTING CODE

For each problem you detect, provide:

Root cause

File path

Original broken code reference

A corrected version that fixes the error

An explanation of why the fix works

DO NOT rewrite working components

DO NOT break existing UI

DO NOT remove functionality I rely on

Only surgically correct what’s wrong

3. EMAIL SYSTEM FULL REPAIR

Audit and fully fix the email sending system:

Check existing API routes

Fix them if broken

Replace any Replit-specific code

Ensure they work on Vercel’s serverless functions

Choose the best and most stable email service for Vercel (Resend or Nodemailer recommended)

Create or repair:
/app/api/send-email/route.js

Make sure:

Form → API route → email sending works perfectly

Inputs are validated

Environment variables are required and referenced safely

The final solution must be 100% deployable on Vercel

4. GENERATE CLEAN .env.example

Include ONLY variables needed for Vercel.

Example structure:

RESEND_API_KEY=
EMAIL_FROM=
NEXT_PUBLIC_BASE_URL=


Also point out any secrets currently hard-coded in the repo.

5. CLEANUP PLAN

Tell me what files I must delete before deploying, including:

.replit

replit.nix

Replit metadata folders

Any other files that break Vercel

6. COMPLETE VERCEL DEPLOYMENT GUIDE

After fixing everything, give a step-by-step deployment guide, including:

Where to place environment variables

Correct build command

Correct output directory

Any dependencies to install

How to test API routes after deployment

How to test email sending on production

7. FINAL VERIFICATION

Simulate:

A full Vercel build

A user submitting the email form

Serverless function successfully sending an email

API routes returning valid JSON

No runtime crashes

Give me the final confirmation.

⚠️ IMPORTANT RULES

DO NOT ask me to paste code. You already have access.

DO NOT delete functioning features.

DO NOT refactor the entire project unless a file is fundamentally broken.

Fix only what is needed for correct functionality + Vercel deployment.
